# Steps
- Make sure that you are getting travel grants as much as possible from various sources (CS, CHCI). See below. You have to get confirmation from the funding sources before submitting the travel approval form. 
- Submit the "Travel Approval Form". The form is available in [Assets](https://github.com/echo-lab/assets/blob/master/Administrative/Travel%20Approval%20Form_REVISED.docx.pdf) or [CS Intnranet](https://admin.cs.vt.edu/forms/).  CS mail code is 106 based on this [link](https://mailservices.vt.edu/content/dam/mailservices_vt_edu/dept_mailcodes.pdf).
- Discuss with Sang regarding how much you should ask to which funding source. In geenral, you need to know the account number. 
- If you do not want to use your own credit card, contact the person that you are submitting the approval form to (Teresa Hall for now).
- Collect all the receipts that you spend while traveling.
- Get reimbursed. Submit a reimbursement form and receipts. (https://admin.cs.vt.edu/forms/)
